<h3>Flavorful Seared Chuck Eye Steak</h3>
<p>
    Seared chuck eye steak is a flavorful and budget-friendly cut that, when cooked right, rivals more expensive steaks. Season the steak generously with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs, then sear it in a hot cast-iron skillet with butter and garlic for a beautifully caramelized crust. 
    Cooking it to medium-rare ensures tender, juicy bites packed with beefy goodness.

    To elevate the meal, pair the steak with roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes and drizzle it with a simple pan sauce made from the steak drippings, butter, and a splash of red wine or broth. 
    This quick and satisfying dish is perfect for a weeknight family dinner or a casual get-together.

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>

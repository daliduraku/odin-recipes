<h3>Delicious dessert for the family</h3>
<p>
    A delicious dessert for the family can be a warm and comforting homemade apple crisp. With sweet, cinnamon-spiced apples baked beneath a buttery, crunchy oat topping, it’s a perfect combination of flavors and textures. 
    Serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.

    For a lighter but equally satisfying option, consider making a fresh fruit tart. A flaky pastry crust filled with a smooth, creamy custard and topped with a variety of colorful berries offers a delightful balance of sweetness and freshness. 
    It’s a visually stunning dessert that’s both refreshing and elegant, perfect for family gatherings.
